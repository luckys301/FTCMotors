ToDo List:
    Add Improved Tank Drive into MecDrive
    Test Angles on Servo
    Test Nebula Motor and Servo
    See if Roadrunner Values show up on Dashboard and are changeable
    Implement Feedforward to all Mechanisms: https://docs.ftclib.org/ftclib/features/controllers
        Trapezoid Motion Profiling
            Find Max Velocity/Acceleration after Tuning by using ArmFeedforward.maxAchievableAcceleration
    Implement all Rev Sensors for use
    Add Units to Mechanisms (Degrees + mm)
    Implement Potentiometer for accurate Arm Movements
    Implement Through Bore Encoder
    How to do Follower Motor - Maybe Reverse Motor?
    Test Anti-Tip
    Have a button to Align to a Direction
    Create Six Wheel Drives
        Add DefaultDriveCommand with Anti-Tip
    CHANGE ALL MOTORS TO NEBULA MOTORS
    Add Through Bore Encoder



Ideas to Implement:
    Write all Device ID Strings in 1 Location

Turning in a Certain Direction //CHeck if this works for other angles
// Turns counter clockwise
drive.turn(Math.toRadians(180) + 1e-6);

// Turns clockwise
drive.turn(Math.toRadians(180) - 1e-6);
