ToDo List:
    Add Improved Tank Drive into MecDrive
    Implement Feedforward to all Mechanisms: https://docs.ftclib.org/ftclib/features/controllers
        Trapezoid Motion Profiling
            Find Max Velocity/Acceleration after Tuning by using ArmFeedforward.maxAchievableAcceleration
    Add Units to Mechanisms (Degrees + mm)
    How to do Follower Motor - Maybe Reverse Motor?
    CHANGE ALL MOTORS TO NEBULA MOTORS
    TRANSFER ALL DRIVETRAIN CONSTANTS into NEBULA CONSTANTS
    Shooter
    Intake - SetPower and at least pid Both Options


Documentation: https://docs.ftclib.org/ftclib/
Turning in a Certain Direction //Check if this works for other angles
    // Turns counter clockwise
    drive.turn(Math.toRadians(180) + 1e-6);

    // Turns clockwise
    drive.turn(Math.toRadians(180) - 1e-6);

Test:
    Test Angles on Servo
    Test Nebula Motor and Servo
    Test Anti-Tip
    See if Roadrunner Values show up on Dashboard and are changeable
    Test Align to a Direction - Teleop
        Alignment to something with PID in teleop
    Test Potentiometer for accurate Arm Movements
    Test Cycle Tracker


Done:
    Create Six Wheel Drives
        Add DefaultDriveCommand with Anti-Tip
    Implement Through Bore Encoder
