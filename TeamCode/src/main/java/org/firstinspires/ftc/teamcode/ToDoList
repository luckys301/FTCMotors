ToDo List:
    Add Improved Tank Drive into MecDrive
    Add Units to Mechanisms (Degrees + mm)
    TRANSFER ALL DRIVETRAIN CONSTANTS into NEBULA CONSTANTS
    Look at Faster Gradle Times - Document for future easy access
    Create Value for Enum GenericType
    Implement Field Centric Turning


Documentation: https://docs.ftclib.org/ftclib/
Turning in a Certain Direction //Check if this works for other angles
    // Turns counter clockwise
    drive.turn(Math.toRadians(180) + 1e-6);
    // Turns clockwise
    drive.turn(Math.toRadians(180) - 1e-6);


Test:
    Test Anti-Tip
    See if Values show up on Dashboard and are changeable
    Test Align to a Direction - Teleop
        Alignment to something with PID in teleop
    Test Potentiometer for accurate Arm Movements
    Driver Override button for the minimum and maximum positions
    TODO: Testing Github CodeSpace
    Test Feedforward
        Find Max Velocity/Acceleration after Tuning by using ArmFeedforward.maxAchievableAcceleration
    Test Motor Group
    TODO: Test if final removes values from Dashboard
    Test Override Safety Boolean + Button
    Test Current Draw
            LynxModule
    Test all Positional Enums Static
    Test Shooter


Done:
    Create Six Wheel Drives
        Add DefaultDriveCommand with Anti-Tip
    Implement Through Bore Encoder
    Test Nebula Motor and Servo - Works
    Test Cycle Tracker - Works
    Fix shooterhood Naming - Simple

    Test Angles on Servo - Doesn't Work, but positional works
    Implement Feedforward to all Mechanisms: https://docs.ftclib.org/ftclib/features/controllers
        Trapezoid Motion Profiling
    CHANGE ALL MOTORS TO NEBULA MOTORS
    Intake - SetPower and at least pid Both Options
    Type in the Type of Motor in Nebula Constants like the RPM of the Motor
    Servo Shooter Hood
    Add the accumulated time of the total CycleTracker
    Would I be able to remove @Config on all extended subsystems?
    Put in GoBilda Type in NebulaMotor
    Add Static for Nebula Constants
    Think How should I do setSetPoint
